Plot Lines or Points
--------------------

Whether data in a plot is to be drawn using lines or points, and if points what shape of points to use, are now selectable from the menus.


Legends
-------

Display of legends in a plot can be disabled by including an "lg=false" parameter to the plot request URL.


Axis Labels
-----------

Greater control of the display of axis labels has been added through the use of the following input parameters to the plot request URL; all are either 0 (absent) or 1 (present), and the listed value is the default.

xTickMarks : 	1
xTickValues : 	1
xUnits : 		1
xLabel : 		0
yTickMarks : 	1
yTickValues : 	1
yUnits : 		1
yLabel : 		0


Time Series Combinations
------------------------

Two time-series plots can now be combined into a new plot with the data from the two originals.  To create such a combined plot, click on the + icon in the first plot's title bar, then click on the plot you wish to combine with the first.


Multi channel plotting
----------------------

Time-series plots can now be requested for multiple channels in a single plot.  This is specified in the plot request by having a comma-separated list of channel IDs in the ch parameter.


Zooming in on plots
-------------------

Clicking on a plot can be used to change the start and end times for the next plot request.  When a click is taken to set the time clicked on as a start time, a green arrow will be drawn at the top of the clicked plot; when the end time is ser, a red arrow will be drawn.  Clicks will alternate between setting the start and end times; no attempt is made to insure the start time preceeds the end time.  If a time-setting click is made in a different plot, the arrows from the old plot will be erased.
